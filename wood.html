            <p>Wood Preservation is the process of treating wood with chemicals or any other biochemical <br> substances that can help to prevent or slow down the deterioration of wood caused by either environmental factors</p>

            <h2>Woodbooring insects.</h2>
            <p>'Woodworm' is the general term used to described common furniture beetle damage. This is the most common damage encountered in buildings. Deathwatch beetle, is almost always encountered in old building where it is mostly found attacking oak. Other 'woodworm' can be found in buildings, the holes of all showing where beetles have emerged from the wood. However, not all 'woodworm' needs treatment.
                <br><br>
                First we establish that the attack is active, dead or the result of one of the innocuous wood boring insects that doesn't require treatment. We also ensure any affected timbers are structurally sound. If active then we will carefully apply the most appropriate low risk preservative to control and eradicate the infestation, again retaining as much of the original timber as possible. Our common sense approach will minimise disruption to the occupants thereby ensuring quick re-occupancy and a safe, comfortable environment.</p>
            <h2>Rot</h2>
            <p>All wood rotting fungi are the result of timbers being kept in contact with persistent dampness. Dry rot is potentially the most serious, having the ability to grow and spread through materials from which it gains no nutritional value such as brick, soil and plasters. The conditions it requires tend to make it 'secretive', and so damage is frequently quite advanced by the time it is discovered. Wet rot, like dry rot these also require wood to be damp. However, in general terms they do not have the ability to spread via damp masonry, plaster, etc. like dry rot; they tend to be very much more restricted to the timber. Sometimes they are difficult to detect as decay can be internal.
                <br><br>
                Primarily we stop the water which is causing the rot - dry wood doesn't rot! So the initial work involves good building practice including repairing defects; this approach retains as much of the original structure and materials as possible, especially important when dealing with historic or period buildings.
                <br><br>
                All materials used in re-instatement are high quality; timbers are isolated from potential dampness and preservative treated where deemed appropriate in accordance with good practice. Such an approach minimises disruption and loss of original materials.</p>
