            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h3>London PDP Ltd is London's local Damp & Wood Preservation Expert. </h3>
            <br><hr><br>
            <p>Here at LondonPDP, We have years of experience in addressing all types of damp and moisture issues, including rising/lateral damp, rot, condensation, plastering, and rendering. You can trust that we will provide professional workmanship for every job. </p>
            <p>We only use superior and certified products in our work along with always following the British Standard Code of Practice. Our standard of work is of utmost importance to us, and we are proud to be approved by the SafeContractor scheme.</p>
            <p>We are proud members of The Property Care Association, SafeContractor, and Trustmark. We work with a variety of clients including homeowners, property management/estate agents, landlords, property developers, and other property professionals. Each client has unique needs and requirements, and we tailor our approach to best suit their situation. Sometimes the work required is simple, and other times clients prefer to leave the entire project in our hands. We also collaborate with architects, structural surveyors, general building contractors, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and decorators to provide all the services needed for a specific project. No matter the size of the project, we can help with prevention, control, and remedial treatment of damp, timber infestation, or rot. We also assist with basement conversions, waterproofing, and refurbishment. Our client base is built on long-standing relationships, recommendations, and word of mouth rather than mass advertising, and we pride ourselves on our traditional values of customer service, reliability, and quality of work.</p>
            <p>Our surveyors are qualified CSRT's (Certified Surveyor of Remedial Treatments) and our survey reports are clear and detailed. Our reputation is built, not only on the quality of our surveys and work, but  also on the honesty of our reports. We always give truthful and well-informed advice, which helps our many and varied clients to make informed choices. It also means we are more than happy to let clients know if no remedial works are required. </p>
            <p>Our treatments are guaranteed by us and we are also able to provide insured guarantees through Specialist Building Guarantees for that extra piece of mind.</p>
            <p>We will be happy to give you advice on any problems you may have and any quotes we provide are without any obligation for you.</p>
            <h2>We look forward to hearing from you by email or telephone and will be happy to discuss your requirements with you.</h2>
