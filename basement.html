            <h2>Basements</h2>
            <p>It has become very popular to extend homes by making an existing cellar or  basement into a useable family space, especially in London where out door space does not always allow for a traditional extension or where a loft conversion would not meet the requirement.
                <br><br>
                Making a basement into a useable space requires specialist knowledge and an understanding of water proofing and the effect that the under ground factors have on the structure. The design of the correct method to protect the space from water ingress is rarely satisfactorily understood by general building contractors with the inevitable consequences of water damage to the new space created.
                <br><br>
                We work together with architects, structural engineers, general building contractors & local authorities to provide a seamless solution to suit your specific needs.
                <br><br>
                If you are thinking of extending your basement, please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss this further and find out how we can help you achieve your new living space.</p>
            <h2>Refurbishments</h2>
            <p>In addition to our core work, damp & timber treatments, we have expanded our service to include refurbishments & redecoration to add the finishing touches to our clients projects. It is often a frustrating process to have work being carried out in your property and our clients often prefer to have one point of contact for their requirements. It saves the client planning access for different trades and the work can often be completed in less time.
                <br><br>
                We work together with plumbers, carpenters, electricians & decorators. We can help you with flooring, kitchen installations, personalised carpentry solutions, bathrooms and many other areas to provide a complete solution for you.</p>
